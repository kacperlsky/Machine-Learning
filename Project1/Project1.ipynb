        "Use gradient descent to iteratively compute the value of $\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{new}}$. Instead of using all the training set in `XTrain` and `yTrain` to compute the gradient, use a subset of $S$ instances in `XTrain` and `yTrain`. This is sometimes called *minibatch gradient descent* where $S$ is the size of the minibacth. When using gradient descent with minibatches, you need to find the best values for three parameters: $\\eta$, the learning rate, $S$, the number of datapoints in the minibatch and $\\gamma$, the regularisation parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In this question we will use the validation data. So before proceeding to the next steps, make sure that you:  replace the missing values on each feature variables with the mean value you computed with the training data; standardise the validation data using the means and standard deviations computed from the training data (**1 mark**).\n",
        "    \n",
        "* Create a grid of values for the parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ using `np.logspace` and a grid of values for $S$ using `np.linspace`. Because you need to find three parameters, start with five values for each parameter in the grid and see if you can increase it. Make sure you understand what is the meaning of `np.logspace` and `np.linspace`. Notice that you can use negative values for `start` in `np.logspace` (**1 mark**).\n",
        "\n",
        "* For each value that you have of $\\gamma$, $\\eta$ and $S$ from the previous step, use the training set to compute $\\mathbf{w}$ using minibatch gradient descent and then measure the RMSE over the validation data. For the validation data, make sure you preprocess it before applying the prediction model over it. For the minibatch gradient descent choose to stop the iterative procedure after $200$ iterations (**1 mark**).\n",
